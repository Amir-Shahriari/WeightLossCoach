BMR Calculation,"BMR is calculated using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation: 
For men: BMR = 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(years) + 5
For women: BMR = 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(years) - 161"
Activity Multipliers,"Activity multipliers adjust BMR based on activity level: 
Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR * 1.2
Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): BMR * 1.375
Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): BMR * 1.55
Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): BMR * 1.725
Extra active (very hard exercise, physical job, or training twice a day): BMR * 1.9"
Calorie Deficit Recommendation,A calorie deficit of 500–750 calories per day is recommended for safe weight loss of 0.5–1 kg per week.
TDEE Calculation,TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is calculated as BMR multiplied by an activity factor determined by activity level.
Calorie Deficit Formula,"Calorie deficit is calculated as: 
Calorie Deficit = TDEE - Calorie Intake"
Weight Loss Guideline,"A safe and sustainable weight loss is 0.5–1 kg per week, requiring a calorie deficit of 3500–7000 calories per week."
Physical Activity Levels,Physical activity levels impact calorie burn and should be considered when calculating TDEE and setting a calorie deficit.
